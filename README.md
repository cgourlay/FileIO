**FileIO**

A library for reading sport activity files.
The readers/writers are based upon the code developed
for the GoldenCheetah desktop application.

These routines have been abstracted out to enable any
project to re-use the file support capabilities in
GoldenCheetah and with a view to setting up a new
and separate project for maintenace and development.
